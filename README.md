This project is a concept tool like a Pomodoro timer, task and time management techniques and tools, and more!

Modernization of jobs saw people move away from farm and industrialized roles into offices and other positions. Physical exercise wasn't built into work. I am writing this from a gym. With AI, you have to maintain your brain and cognitive skills!

My dialog with ChatGPT regarding this, and vibe coding start of an app to manage this.
